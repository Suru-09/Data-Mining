# Intro and data set
--------
- Game of Thrones is a series of five books* written by George R. R. Martin between 1996 and 2011
- Three main stories interweave: a dynastic war among several families, the rising threat of the supernatural and the ambition of the deposed king's exiled daughter to assume the “Iron Throne”

- ** actually they should be seven, but the author hasn't published anything in the last decade, so we are still waiting for Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.
## Problem statement
--------
- We aim to investigate the differences in author’s writing style from the first book of his series up to the third one. We hope to discover his pattern of choices while manipulating the characters ( they have a tendency to die) as well as the preferred atmosphere and intercalation of the three main storylines.
## Note
-----------
- In order to run any of the secondary notebooks you should first run the cleaning notebook (thus obtaining the cleaned data necesarry for further analysis).
- We converted our book from .pdf format to .txt format using the method : PdfToTextConverter.py, which can be found in utils.
- The above mentioned methods uses PyPdf and pdfminer as frameworks.
- Also we have almost every requirements (necesarry in order to run the notebooks) in the requirements.txt file.
## Conclusions
### It was fun
- We tried to find new perspectives using both the knowledge accumulated during the courses and laboratories and also by using our curiosity, e.g. we wanted to see how many characters died from the first book until the third one. (G.O.T. is pretty well-known for killing its characters ;) )
